            <p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Bootcamp is not over for me yet, but I wished someone would have given me these advices. So, I signed up for a coding bootcamp and had no idea what I was getting myself into. I did not even know what a technical test was! I researched on Google for mothers who also did coding bootcamps and even coders with disabilities. I was really worried about my health and the stress that it would take on my body. In 2013, I became completely blind in my left eye for a year due to my autoimmune illness, NMOSD, and I was even paralyzed from the walking for several months due to it. However, my body recovered from that, but I had another NMOSD attack in 2016 that gave me permanent vision loss in my left eye while pregnant with my second child. So, I tried to find documentation and even went on group chats that I was in to ask if anyone had ever attended or even attempted to do bootcamp. I didn’t get many replies. Yet, that didn’t stop me. I prayed to God what should I do with my life if I was to survive COVID in early August of this year, and a Perficient ad for this bootcamp appeared on my Facebook newsfeed. I took that as a sign and ran with it!</p>
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>One thing that I am glad that I did prior to bootcamp, besides freaking out even though I told myself not to, was Google what HTML, CSS, JavaScript was. The next thing I did was sign up for free courses on Freecodecamp, Codeacademy, and I bugged admissions to give me more resources for me to study so that I can at least know what terms to familiarize myself with. I have ZERO background in coding. I took a class on technical writing in college. That is not even what writing code is except being able to spell correctly. If I may add, spelling correctly is essential in this line of work! Even if there is spell check, some applications do not have the luxury of providing one for you to use. </p>
            <p>Be patient with yourself. You are learning how to learn again. It is easier said than done. You are learning how to ask the right questions, how to look up the right questions with the right key words, how to input the right code to get the right output. Yet, the language in which you are use to is not quite necessarily the format in which the computer wants. I am still learning how to code. I can honestly say it is hard. I have to pseudo code almost every one of my coding challenges. However, with each challenge I see that I get better at picking up the concept that I have learned. I see that my thought process is changing. This stay-at-home Mom has learned a new way of learning, and so can you. </p>
            <p>Get a support team in place. You will get through this program through your own sheer hard work and determination, but a great support foundation goes a long way! I have to say that I would not have made it so far without my husband’s, Myles, help. He dropped and picked up the kids to and from school for me. He did the grocery shopping for me while I spent a couple of hours a night coding lab homework. He told me I was smarter than anyone when I kept doubting myself that I was not. My Mom made weekly meals for me since some days I would not have time to cook meals that took more than 20 minutes. </p>
            <p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Bootcamp is a tough road. Seek help from those around you. You will gravitate towards someone. My person I clicked with immediately in my cohort was Tim. Tim’s energy is so contagious that we have a phrase for it, “Tim it up!” He was my go-to when labs were a bit of a challenge and he just understood me. You need a friend that you can just vent to and talk code to sometimes. Often, you need a pair of fresh eyes and befriending your cohort classmate is not just beneficial for you but for them as well. Don't be afraid to open up. You never know if you are that ray of sunshine for someone else!</p>
            <p>A week prior to the bootcamp actually starting, I read somewhere that in order to make it, I would have to eat, sleep, code and repeat. Bootcamp so far has been almost that life for me. I do suggest taking very good notes. I saw a HUGE difference in my assessments score after I started to type out step by step what the instructors were saying, almost verbatim. I know it isn't practical for most people, but if you can do it, I suggest doing that. Being organized with folders, challenges, lectures, labs will go a <b>LONG</b> way when it comes time for assessments and your capstone. Your notes could help your fellow classmates out as well. Put comment in your codes!!! I strongly suggest this! This is how I turned my assessments grades around <b>IMMEDIATELY</b> after week 2! Because I am still learning, I often refer back to my notes, old assessments/labs, and will reread how or why I did things a certain way. </p>
            
            <p>These are the things I wished someone told me prior to starting bootcamp. I hope this helps someone, even one person, who is considering doing a bootcamp. Just do it. I am taking this during the pandemic and it is drastically different than what I am use to but it is a new way of learning and working. If you are a Mom and think you can’t, YOU CAN! Do it for yourself! You dedicate 1000% into making others great, you can put 50% of that into yourself! Good luck! As started this blog as a way to help others, but in return it has help me realize the growth that sprouted in the last 8 weeks of doing this bootcamp. You learn a lot about what you are capable of in a short amount of time under immense pressure. I'm sure I'll reread this myself when I am doubtful during specialization.But I've made it thus far, and that was the biggest hurdle yet. The best is yet to come!</p>
