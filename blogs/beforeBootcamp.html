            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>So, I signed up for a coding bootcamp and had no idea what I was getting myself into. I did not even know a technical test was! I researched on Google for working Moms or even for women coders for advice on how to survive this program with kids. I was really worried about my health and the stress that it would take on my body. In 2012-2013, I became blind in my left eye completely for a year due to my autoimmune illness, NMOSD, and I was even paralyzed from the walking for several months due to it. However, my body recovered from that, but I had another NMOSD attack in 2016 that gave me permanent vision loss in my left eye while pregnant with my second child. So, I tried to find documentation and even went on group chats that I was in to ask if anyone had ever attended or even attempted to do bootcamp. I didn’t get many replies. Yet, that didn’t stop me. I asked for God what should I do with my life if I was to survive covid in early August and a Perficient ad for this bootcamp appeared on my Facebook newsfeed. I took that as a sign and ran with it!</p>
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>One thing that I am glad that I did prior to bootcamp, besides freaking out even though I told myself not to, was Google what HTML, CSS, JavaScript was. The next thing I did was sign up for free courses on Freecodecamp, Codeacademy, and I bugged admissions to give me more resources for me to study so that I can at least know what terms to familiarize myself with. I have ZERO background in coding. I took a class on technical writing in college. That is not even near writing code except being able to spell correctly. If I may add, spelling correctly is essential in this line of work! Even if there is spell check, some applications do not have the luxury of it. </p>
